 * Static members in libraries are a challenge for confined task isolation. Third-party libraries can be reloaded,
 * but JDK (platform) classes cannot. It is important that classes with JVM-wide state are initialized outside the
 * sandbox; if they are initialized by a confined task, they may hold references to that task or be interrupted
 * in the middle of their initialization, thereby ruining the class for the entire JVM. This method, called before
 * any confined tasks are started, initializes important shared platform classes.
